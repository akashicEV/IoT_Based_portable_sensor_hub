# IoT_Based_portable_sensor_hub
The portable Sensor HUB with IoT Integration project revolutionizes environmental monitoring and control through advanced sensor technologies, microcontrollers, and IoT communication protocols. Utilizing STM32F407 and ESP32 microcontrollers as central processing units, the project seamlessly integrates multiple sensors, including the BMP180 for barometric pressure sensing and the GY-906 for infrared temperature measurement. CAN communication with MCP2551 CAN transceivers ensures reliable inter-microcontroller communication, while MQTT communication with the ThingsBoard IoT platform enables remote monitoring and control.

A key component of the project is the intuitive user interface implemented on the DMG48270C043_04WTC DWIN touch display, designed using Canva. This interface provides users with an interactive platform to monitor sensor readings, control system parameters, and visualize data trends effortlessly. The project's significance lies in its ability to enhance situational awareness, improve decision-making processes, and optimize resource utilization across various domains such as agriculture, industrial automation, and smart infrastructure.
